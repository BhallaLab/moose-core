We use the `fork-and-pull` workflow for moose development.

To contribute:
1. Fork this repo on github
2. Make the changes you want to contribute
3. Check that moose builds locally on your version
4. Check all tests pass `ctest --output-on-failure` passes all tests (TODO: cleanup/fix/update the tests)
5. Submit your changes via a pull-request.

After this the repository admin will check your pull request and merge it to the main branch.
