This is a demo for single compartmental leaky integrate and fire
neurons, that is, class IntFire in MOOSE. They are same as Compartment
except that they do not have axial resistance and the membrane
potential Vm is set to reset potential Vr after each spike. Also, the
computation in SpikeGen has been implemented into the IntFire class so
that you do not need a separate SpikeGen object for creating and
passing spike events.
