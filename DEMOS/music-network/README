About this demo
---------------
This demo showcases MOOSE / MUSIC compatibility.

MUSIC (MUlti-SImulation Coordinator) allows multiple simulators to exchange
simulation information at runtime. In this demo, MUSIC coordinates 2 instances
of MOOSE to simulate a simple feed-forward neuronal network. One instance of
MOOSE simulates the input layer, while the other instance of MOOSE simulates
the output layer. MUSIC conveys spike timing information from the first
simulation to the second, thus combining the input and output layers into a
whole network.

You can also run the entire network in a single instance of MOOSE (or GENESIS).
The output from this simulation can be used to confirm if the MOOSE/MUSIC/MOOSE
simulation is running correctly.

The entire simulation is run in parallel (needs MPI and MUSIC installed), and
each MOOSE instance can itself be running in parallel.

Running the simulation
----------------------
This simulation can be run in any of the following ways:

	genesis MusicNetwork.g full
	moose MusicNetwork.g full
	mpirun -np 2 music net-1.music
	mpirun -np 4 music net-2.music

The MusicNetwork script can be run in one of 3 modes: Full, Source, Destination.
The mode can be selected from the command line:

	<simulator> <script> [full|src|dest]

The Source and Destination modes are meant to be invoked using MUSIC. You can
run these modes without MUSIC too, but that is not much fun.

---------
The model
---------
In its full form, 2 sets of neurons are created: Input and Output. The i-th
input neuron synapses onto the i+3 and i-3 output neurons. All the cells are
single compartment cells, with HH channels that allow them to show spiking
activity. The input neurons are injected with different amounts of current.

Schematic of full network:

	INPUT          OUTPUT
	-----          ------
	 I-0       +--- O-0
	 I-1      /     O-1
	 I-2     /      O-2
	 I-3 ---+       O-3
	 I-4     \      O-4
	 I-5      \     O-5
	 I-6       +--- O-6
	 I-7            O-7
	  .              .
	  .              .

The simulation can also be run in the form of 2 half networks, communicating
through the MUSIC library:

	INPUT                                      OUTPUT
	-----                                      ------

	|=== source =======|============ dest ===========|

	  I-0 ----- OC-0 |   |------ IC-0       +--- O-0
	  I-1 ----- OC-1 | M |------ IC-1      /     O-1
	  I-2 ----- OC-2 | U |------ IC-2     /      O-2
	  I-3 ----- OC-3 | S |------ IC-3 ---+       O-3
	  I-4 ----- OC-4 | I |------ IC-4     \      O-4
	  I-5 ----- OC-5 | C |------ IC-5      \     O-5
	  I-6 ----- OC-6 |   |------ IC-6       +--- O-6
	  I-7 ----- OC-7 |   |------ IC-7            O-7
	   .          .                .              .
	   .          .                .              .

In the 'source' simulation, input neurons (I-0, I-1, ...) send their output
to channels (OC-0, OC-1, ...) in the MUSIC output port. In the 'dest' simulation
input channels (IC-0, IC-1, ...) receive these signals as spike times, and relay
them on to the output neurons (O-0, O-1, ...).

For running using MUSIC, use one of the folowing configuration files:
	net-1.music: 1 source process + 1 dest process
	net-2.music: 2 source processes + 2 dest processes

Output
------
If you run this simulation using MOOSE, GENESIS and MOOSE/MUSIC, then the
following output plots will be generated:

	output/moose.plot
	output/genesis.plot
	output/music-1.plot
	output/music-2.plot

After that, if you have gnuplot, you can give the folowing command:

	gnuplot plot.gnuplot

which will plot the above graphs, and write them as images in the output folder.
