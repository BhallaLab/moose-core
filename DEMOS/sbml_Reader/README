This demo reads an SBML model into moose, runs a simulation, and produces its plot.

To run this script use the command 'moose Reader.g'. The output is stored in
the file 'moose.plot'. If you have xplot or gnuplot installed, then you can
view the plots using the following commands:
	'xplot moose.plot'
	'gnuplot plot.gnuplot'.

If you wish to load a different SBML model, edit the Reader.g script. You will
need to modify the value of the 'infile' variable.

Similarly, if you wish to generate a plot for all the species present in a given
model, or only a selected few, you will need to to edit the script to achieve
this. Refer to the comments in the script for further instructions.
