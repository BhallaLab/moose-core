This demo loads a biochemical model in the Genesis kinetikit format into moose
and generates its xml. Then it runs a simulation, and produces its plot.

To run this script use the command 'moose Writer.g'. The output is stored in
the file 'moose.plot'. If you have xplot or gnuplot installed, then you can
view the plots using the following commands:
	'xplot moose.plot'
	'gnuplot plot.gnuplot'.

If you wish to load a different genesis model, edit the Writer.g script. You will
need to modify the filename after the 'include' command.
