This demo performs a 'round trip' with a given SBML model. In other words,
it reads an SBML model into moose, runs a simulation, and produces its 
plot. Then it writes out the same model into another SBML file and finally,
reads back the written model. Then runs a simulation, and produces its plot.

To run this script use the command 'moose RoundTrip.g'. The output is stored in
the file 'moose1.plot'and 'moose2.plot' for first and second simulation respectively.
If you have xplot or gnuplot installed, then you can view the plots using the
following commands:
	'xplot moose1.plot' and 'xplot moose2.plot'
	'gnuplot plot.gnuplot'.

If you wish to load a different SBML model, edit the RoundTrip.g script. You will
need to modify the value of the 'infile' variable.

Similarly, if you wish to generate a plot for all the species present in a given
model, or only a selected few, you will need to edit the script to achieve
this. Refer to the comments in the script for further instructions.
