This is the MOOSE Beta 1.1.0 release

MOOSE is the base and numerical core for large, detailed simulations including
Computational Neuroscience and Systems Biology. MOOSE spans the range from
single molecules to subcellular networks, from single cells to neuronal
networks, and to still larger systems. It is backwards-compatible with
GENESIS, and forward compatible with Python. A key goal of MOOSE is to
embrace many simulation and numerical engines that span a range of levels of 
simulation, and to provide the infrastructure to enable these to interoperate
seamlessly. This release of MOOSE supports 2 main solvers: for neuronal 
biophysics using custom code and for deterministic reaction-diffusion 
simulations using the GNU Scientific Library routines.
