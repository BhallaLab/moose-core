This directory has demo simulations for MOOSE. To run them you should
cd into the appropriate subdirectory and type moose <scriptfile>
as given below. Please note that you need write permissions to the
demo directories, since all the demos generate file output. You may
have to copy the entire DEMOS directory to your home folder for this.

Directory	Command		Output file(s)		NOTES
axon		moose Axon.g	axon*.moose.plot	Another axon model.
channels	moose Channels.g  *.moose.plot		Tests channel properties
kholodenko	moose Kholodenko.g test.plot		Kinetic simuation test
							Output not compatible
							with gnuplot.
							Ignore warnings about 
							simundumpfunc and setfield
mitral-ee	moose Mitral.g	mitral.moose.plot	Large mitral cell model
myelin		moose Myelin.g	*.moose.plot		Myelinated axon
network-ee	moose Network.g				Models a small network
pymoose		python squid.py				Needs moose.py
rallpack1	moose Rallpack1.g cable-*.moose.plot	Passive cable test
rallpack2	moose Rallpack2.g branch*.moose.plot	Branched passive cable
rallpack3	moose Rallpack3.g axon_*.moose.plot	Hodkin-Huxley axon 
squid-ee	moose Squid.g	squid.moose.plot	Hodkin-Huxley Squid model
synapse		moose Synapse.g	*.moose.plot		Synaptic transmission
traub91		moose Traub91.g	*.moose.plot		Traub CA3 cell model

To run in Windows, you may have to first open a DOS shell and cd into the 
demo subdirectory you wish to try. Then type
..\..\..\moose <scriptfile>
to run the demo.

In most subdirectories you can then use gnuplot to look at the output using
the command:
gnuplot plot.gnuplot
