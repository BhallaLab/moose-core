Rallpack Demo Scripts
---------------------

Rallpack scripts are stored in rall.1, rall.2 and rall.3 folders.

These scripts store their time series output in files starting with "sim_"

Reference curves can be found in the following files:
	Rallpack 1: ref_cable.0, ref_cable.x
	Rallpack 2: ref_branch.0, ref_branch.x
	Rallpack 3: ref_axon.0.genesis, ref_axon.x.genesis

For viewing the plots using gnuplot one can use the *.gnuplot scripts like this:
	$ gnuplot rall.1.gnuplot
A new window containing the plot will appear and stay for 5 seconds, and plots
will be stored as PNG images.
