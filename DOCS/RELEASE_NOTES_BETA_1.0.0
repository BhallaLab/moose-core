These are the release notes for MOOSE Beta 1.0.0

Websites:
http://moose.ncbs.res.in
http://moose.sourceforge.net

What is MOOSE:
A GENESIS compatible (well, mostly) simulator rewritten from scratch in C++.
Models everything from single molecule dynamics to large neural networks.
Runs natively on Linux, Solaris, Mac, (probably other Unices), and Windows.
Designed for automatic parallelization and Python and XML interfaces.

What to get:
Binaries for your favourite platform
(Optional) DOCS tree for documentation and TESTS tree for examples.
(For the brave) Source tree for building the whole thing on your system.

Why to get it:
To begin the process of getting your GENESIS models to run on MOOSE.
To help with building a next-generation simulator.

What the main distro does:
GENESIS scripting
Kinetic simulations
Single-neuron simulations
Network simulations.

You can see examples in the TESTS/regression and DOCS/Demos directories.
Hopefully, your GENESIS program will Just Work.
More likely, you will need to fine-tune a few scripts to work around calls
	we haven't implemented yet.
Also likely, you need features we haven't put in. Let us know through bug
	reports and we'll prioritize.
Possible, it doesn't work. See above.

What you can play with:
GSL integration for chemical kinetic models (some 9 numerical methods)
	This needs you to have GSL libraries installed.
SMOLDYN interface for single-particle reaction-diffusion kinetic simulations
	(Thanks, Steven Andrews) This needs SMOLDYN to be installed.
MPI-based parallel simulations (Thanks, Mayuresh, Parag, and CRL team).
	This needs MPI to be installed.

What to do when it crashes or if it doesn't do what you need:
Submit a bug report on SourceForge at 
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=165660&atid=836272
