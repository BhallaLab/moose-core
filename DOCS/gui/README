File: DOCS/gui/README
=============================

The primary content of this directory is moosegui.texi and a bunch of
.PNG files that are referenced in moosegui.texi. The subdirectory
moosegui has html pages generated from moosegui.texi. The command for
this is:

makeinfo --html moosegui.texi

This is what the provided Makefile does. 

Also, one can also generate a single pdf file from the texinfo file
using texi2pdf:

texi2pdf moosegui.texi

The reason for keeping the generated moosegui directory as part of the
source is because "makeinfo --html" does not copy the image files to
the build directory. Also, the resolution of the images for html
version is different from that for pdf version.
