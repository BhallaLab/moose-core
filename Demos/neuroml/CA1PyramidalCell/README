This is the directory for the NeuroML files generated by neuroConstruct 1.5.3 (neuroConstruct.org) for CA1 cell model.
These files were exported from neuroConstruct as Level 3 NeuroML v 1.x files (not a single NeuroML Level 3 file).

Fire up moose GUI. File->Load Model or Ctrl+L. Navigate to this directory.
Select and open the CA1.net.xml or CA1soma.net.xml file.
[
CA1soma.net.xml instantiates a CA1 cell having only the soma.
CA1.net.xml instantiates a detailed CA1 model, however it has been modified from that exported from neuroConstruct.
Some inhomogeneous channels in the dendrites, and some negative conductance (!) channels were removed, hence it fires spontaneously.

Select the soma (graphical viewer or element tree) and click 'add field' on the right 'plot configuration' pane to plot Vm.
Run the simulation and see the soma Vm.

To test on the terminal, just run python CA1.py (pops up soma Vm).
