This is the directory for the NeuroML files used by Aditya Gilra in his rodent olfactory bulb model.

Fire up moose GUI. File->Load Model or Ctrl+L. Navigate to this directory. Load any of these models:
OBpassive_numgloms3_seed750.0.xml : 3 glomeruli (2 mitral cells in each) with lots of granule and PG cells.
OBpassive_slice_numgloms2_seed100.0_fewcells.xml : 2 glomeruli with very few granule and PG cells (good for testing).
OBpassive_slice_numgloms2_seed100.0.xml : 2 glomeruli with granules and PGs present only in a slice of 300 microns thickness.

Presently all cells have only passive properties, no active channels, and no synapses and connections,
 as not all channels have been converted to ChannelML, and it saves loading time.
