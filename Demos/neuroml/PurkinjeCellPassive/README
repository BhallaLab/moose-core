This is the directory for the NeuroML files generated by neuroConstruct 1.5.3 (neuroConstruct.org) for Purkinje cell model.
These files were exported from neuroConstruct as Level 3 NeuroML v 1.x files (not a single NeuroML Level 3 file).

Fire up moose GUI. File->Load Model or Ctrl+L. Navigate to this directory.
Open the PurkinjePassive.net.xml file.
Presently this cell has only passive properties, no active channels,
 as all the channels exported by neuroConstruct were in old deprecated ChannelML format which current importer does not support.
You can set the inject field in the soma or any other compartment and see how the voltage passive decays.
