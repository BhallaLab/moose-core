This is the port of Hodgkin-Huxley Squid Giant Axon demo from
GENESIS. Run `python squid_demo.py` to start the GUI. Open help.org in
a text editor or help.html in a web-browser (or click `Help` button in
the GUI) to read the tutorial.

The biophysical model is in `squid.py`.  The electronics setup is in
`electronics.py`.  The combination of squid axon model and the
electronics is in squid_setup.py. All these can be run without any GUI
dependency. To run squid_demo.py you need PyQt and matplotlib with Qt
backend installed.
