  You can hover the mouse cursor on any icon on this toolbar to get a
  brief tool-tip. To summarize:

** Zoom
   1. Zoom-in:
      1) Zoom-in both X and Y axes:	 
	 - click on the subplot you want to zoom and scroll mouse
           wheel down, or
	 - click magnifier icon and press left mouse button on the
           subplot and drag. This will zoom the subplot to the
           rectangle you cover by this.
	 - click compass icon and press right mouse button on the plot
           and drag towards top-right.
      2) Zoom-in along X-axis: 
         - click compass icon and press right mouse button on the plot
           and drag towards right.
      3) Zoom-in along  Y-axis:
         - click compass icon and press right mouse button on the plot
           and drag upwards.
   2. Zoom-out:
      1) Zoom-out both X and Y axes:
	 - click on the subplot you want to zoom and scroll mouse wheel up, or
	 - click magnifier icon and press right mouse button on the
           plot and drag. The whole visible axis area will fit into
           the rectangle you cover by this.
	 - click compass icon and press right mouse button on the plot
           and drag towards bottom-left.
      2) Zoom-out whole plot window along X-axis: 
	 - click compass icon and press right mouse button on the plot
           and drag towards left.
      3) Zoom-out Y-axis: 
	 - click compass icon and press right mouse button on the plot
           and drag downwards.
   3. Go forward/backward in zoom stack: 
      click right/left arrow icon.
** Pan:
   click compass-icon and left click-and-drag
** Reset to initial plot state: 
   click home icon.
** Change spacing and position of subplots: 
   click button with four green arrow-heads pointing (this is called
   the Subplot-Configuration button).
** Configure axes: 
   click green tick-mark. In the pop-up dialog select the axis you want
   to modify and click OK. In the next dialog you can set the range of
   X and Y values for the axes and modify several other properties.
** Save plot: 
   click floppy-disk icon.

* Rearranging the frames on small screens
  The default layout of the squid demo may exceed available screen
  size on your system. But you can always undock the control panels
  and put them one over the other to save screen space. To undock all
  panels in one go, click the "Undock all" button in the tool bar.

  To move or float a single panel, click the left mouse button on its
  title bar (in the same horizontal line with the expand buttons) of
  any of the panels and drag. You can choose to leave it floating or
  drop it somewhere (top, left, bottom or right of the plot window) in
  the main window to reposition it. You can drop multiple panels in
  the same location. Then they will be put as multiple tabs over one
  another.

  An undocked panel will be always on top of the main window. If this
  is a problem, you can close it by clicking the close button. You can
  make it visible again by clicking "Show all" button on the tool bar.

  SQUID
  
  An Introductory Tutorial for GENESIS, XODUS, and the HODGKIN-HUXLEY model

  By M. Nelson, Caltech, April 1989 - Modified by D. Beeman, June 1991, Dec 1994
                                  \- Modified by E. Vigmond, September 1993

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In the process of working through this tutorial, you will learn
  something about the Hodgkin-Huxley model.  This program may serve as
  a good starting point for those of you who plan to work on
  single-cell models for a course project.

** The Model
   For the time being, we are going to simulate a single axon
   compartment with active Na and K conductances, as described by Hodgkin
   and Huxley for the squid giant axon.  In other tutorials we will link
   compartments together to form a simple model of an entire neuron with
   a soma and dendrites (the Neuron tutorial), model a cable with many
   compartments (the cable tutorial), and build neural circuits with
   connected neurons (MultiCell and tritonia).  For now, we confine
   ourselves to a single axon compartment.

** Running the Simulation
   The model has already been initialized with some reasonable
   parameter values, so all you have to do to run the simulation is:

   click on the ``Run`` button in the toolbar.

   The simulation which you just observed was for a constant current
   pulse, which is shown in the lower left graph panel.  The upper left
   graph shows the membrane potential.  You can see that 3 action
   potentials were generated during this 50 msec simulation.  Now let's
   change the injection current and see what happens.
   
   At the bottom of the left panel is a widget labeled "Electronics"
   and inside it there are two tabs labeled ``Current clamp`` and
   ``Voltage clamp``. Select the ``Current clamp`` tab and you will
   see a series of labeled text boxes with default values. In order
   to change the injection current:

   position the cursor to the right of the last digit in the "First
   Pulse Current" field and click in the text box with the left mouse
   button.

   Let's change the peak injection current from 0.1 to 1.0.

   type <BACKSPACE> to delete the 0.1 and then type 1.0

   The value in the dialog field should now be 1.0. 

   Now we'll run the simulation again.

   click the "Run" button on the toolbar again.

   There should be a dramatic change in the time-course of the
   membrane potential at this higher current injection level.
   Experiment with the injection level to see what happens to the
   axon at higher injection currents.  Also try decreasing the
   injection level until an action potential is no longer elicited by
   the stimulus.  What is the threshold for producing an action
   potential in this compartment?

   You may also experiment with trains of short pulses.  Set the
   "First Pulse Width" dialog field to 1 msec and click on the
   "Single Pulse" drop down box and select "Pulse Train".  Now vary
   "First Onset Delay".  What is the minimum interval between action
   potentials that you can achieve?

** Voltage Clamping
   You can also perform voltage clamp experiments in this simulation.

   click on the "Voltage clamp" tab header at the bottom of the
   control form under "Electronics".

   Again, reasonable default values have been selected , so all you
   have to do to run the voltage clamp simulation is:

   click the "Run" button on the control form

** Changing Extracellular Concentrations
   You can alter the extracellular concentrations of the ions through
   the "Channels" panel.  Any changes in concentration will cause the
   reversal potentials to be recalculated.  To reset the values back
   to the initial ones, just click on the "Restore defaults" button
   in the top tool bar.

** Controlling Graphs
   The graph of the clamp current (lower left panel) has gone off
   scale.  In order to rescale the graph:

   click on the button with green tick mark in the navigation toolbar
   at the bottom of the plots.

   A dialog containing drop-down to select the subplot should appear.
   Select the "Injection current" and click OK. Another dialog box
   will appear with text boxes for `Min` and `Max` values for X-Axis
   and Y-Axis. Adjust for Y axis to bring the graph into range and
   press "Apply".


   The top toolbar has an "Overlay plots" button.  When it is
   checked, any existing plots in the graph will be held and new
   simulation results will be overlayed. Try this now.

   Click "Overlay plots" and run the simulation at several values of
   the clamp voltage. Do the first run with "Overlay plots" button
   unchecked so that all previous graphs are cleared at this
   run. Then click this button to checked state and do the subsequent
   runs.

** State Plots
   One can learn a great deal by studying plots in which one of the
   Hodgkin-Huxley channel activation parameters (the K activation
   "n", the Na activation "m", or the Na inactivation "h") is plotted
   as a function of the membrane potential, V.  (See, for example,
   Chapter 5 of "Methods in Neuronal Modeling", by Koch and Segev.)

   In order to view such a plot, click the left mouse button on the
   button labeled "State plot" in the top toolbar. The label will
   change to "State Plot Visible", and a state plot graph will
   appear. Clicking the button again will hide the graph.  The
   default plot is to show the K channel "n" parameter on the y-axis
   and the membrane potential on the x-axis.  The drop-down menus at
   the top of the window allow you to change these defaults.

** Channel Blocking
   In order to explore the effects of blocking one of the channels,
   you may click on one of the check boxes in the "Channels" panel
   for blocking and unblocking a channel.  When a channel is blocked,
   its conductance is set to zero.  Activation parameters for a
   blocked channel are still calculated and may be plotted, but are
   relatively meaningless because they will have no effect on the
   membrane potential.

** Saving Graphs
   You can save a graph to file by clicking the save button in the
   navigation toolbar. In the file dialog you can select from several
   formats including PDF, JPEG, PNG and SVG.

** Units used in the simulation
   Units: 
   | quantity                      | unit         |
