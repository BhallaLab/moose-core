Building new MOOSE classes.

- Take your existing class.
- Set it up to use access functions of this form:

	For things that should look like Read/Write variables to the user:
	 void setField( FieldType value ); 
	 FieldType getField() const;

	For things that should look like ReadOnly variables to the user:
	 FieldType getField() const;
	
	For things that should look like functions to the user:
	( MOOSE can handle up to 6 arguments )
	 void func( Type1 arg1, Type2 arg2 );
		
- Put in the following function in the header:
	static const Cinfo* initCinfo();
	

- Figure out your MOOSE interface. There are three main kinds of fields, 
	which are going to be set up using Finfo objects (short for Field 
	Information).
	The three are:
		- DestFinfos: These handle function requests.
		- SrcFinfos: These call functions on other objects. In other
			words, they send messages.
		- ValueFinfos: These support field assignment and readout.


- Define initCinfo() in your .cpp, as follows:
