Naming conventions:
General: Use CamelCase
Don't use underscores as word separators.
Classes start with caps
Fields and functions start with lower case, except for scientific
	conventions (e.g., Vm_) in which case the scientific convention is used.
Private fields end with an underscore (e.g., Vm_ );
Use spaces liberally, and always after a comma.
Field assignment functions (set/get) start with set/get<fieldName>

Naming of MOOSE fields and functions:
Fields (ValueFinfos): Just use the name of the field, e.g., Vm, x, y, z.
Message sources (SrcFinfos): Use the name of the field, e.g., output,
	unless there is a name-clash with a Fields. Then use name<Suffix>
	e.g., nOut, xOut, VmOut.
	If the message source is to request a return value, generally use the
	form request<fieldName>
Message destination (DestFinfos): Use the name of the function, typically a 
	verb. e.g., increment, process. 
	Special case comes up with the internal set/get functions of fields,
	which are implemented as DestFinfos. Here the DestFinfos are
	automatically named set_<fieldname> and get_<fieldname>
	If the message dest handles a request or other operation as part of
	a shared message, generally use the form
	handle<name>
	If there is an overlap with a SharedMessage or field after applying
	all these rules, then use the form handle<name>.
Shared messages (SharedFinfos): Use the name of the message.
	If there is an overlap with any other message, the SharedMessage takes
	precedence. This is because Shared Messages are the interface users
	will normally use. Try to avoid overlaps with field names.
