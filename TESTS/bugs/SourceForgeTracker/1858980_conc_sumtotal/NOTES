These two examples behave differently in GENESIS, but the same in MOOSE.
In GENESIS, the one with the SLAVE message scales up according to the volume,
but the one with the SUMTOTAL message does not.
In MOOSE, both scale up with the volume.

I am going to keep it this way, for two reasons:
- It is unlikely to break anything, and would be difficult to convert to the
	GENESIS form.
- The original verison is arguably less logical. With the current version I
	can scale SUMTOTAL inputs or not, as the case may be.
