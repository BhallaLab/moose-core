This directory has regression tests for MOOSE. These are tests which 
exercise some aspect of MOOSE function by running a specific model.
The idea is that all these tests should be run automatically with a single
command.

To run the regression tests, type 'source do_regression.bat'

To add a new test to the ones here, you will need to do the following:

1. Set up a model to test. Ideally this should be a single script file.
2. Tweak the script of the model so that it automatically generates an output 
	file called 'test.plot', and then quits.
3. Generate a plot of your reference output. This should have the same name
	as your script file, but with the suffix .plot instead of the .g
4. Append three lines to the script 'do_regression.bat' in the format you see
	for earlier scripts.
