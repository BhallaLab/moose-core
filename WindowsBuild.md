# Building MOOSE on Windows with MSVC

## Install requirements
* Install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)
* Install either MS Visual Studio 2019 or MS Visual Studio Build Tools 2019, including the Windows SDK.
  Add path to this folder in your `PATH` environment variable.
* Install the LLVM compiler infrastructure (https://releases.llvm.org/download.html). You can either install it directly, adding its bin folder to the `PATH` environment variable, or install it with winget from the commandline: `winget install llvm`
  - To add its executables to PATH in PowerShell, run: `$env:PATH="$env:PATH;C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin"`
  - Alternatively, if using `cmd.exe` command prompt, add its executables to PATH in cmd, run: `set PATH="%PATH%;C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin"`
* [Skip] For MPI install MS-MPI (https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-MPI/releases/), the only free MPI for Windows
  - TODO: MPI-build on Windows is not supported yet

## Python virtual environment
You may want to use a system like Anaconda (or [Miniforge with Mamba, or Micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)), which will allow you to create isolated Python environments. There  are binary packages for most of the requirements in the conda channel `conda-forge`. 

If you want to keep things slim, `micromamba` may be ideal because it is a single statically linked C++ executable and does not install any base environment.

In this guide, `conda` command can be replaced by `mamba` or `micromamba` if you are using one of those systems. 

To create an environment, open Anaconda command prompt and enter

```
conda create -n moose meson ninja meson-python gsl hdf5 numpy matplotlib vpython pkg-config pybind11[global] clang -c conda-forge
```

*Note: Please make sure you are using the `conda-forge` channel (`-c conda-forge`) for installing `GSL` and not the anaconda `defaults`. The latter causes linking error*

This will create an environment name `moose`. In some terminals (windows `cmd`) you may get an error for `pybind11[global]`. Put it inside quotes to work around it.

Then activate this environment for your build:

```
conda activate moose
```

## Build and install moose using `pip`
```
pip install git=https://github.com/BhallaLab/moose-core
```

## Build moose for development
*Note: The commands below are designed for PowerShell.*
* Get moose source code by cloning `moose-core` source code using git
```
git clone https://github.com/BhallaLab/moose-core --depth 50 
```

* If you have not already set the path to LLVM binaries, run 

```
$env:PATH="$env:PATH;C:\Program Files\LLVM\bin"
```
  
```
cd moose-core
meson setup --wipe _build -Duse_mpi=false --buildtype=release --vsenv
meson compile -vC _build 
meson install -C _build
```
*Note: If you want to keep the installation in local folder replace the third command with: `meson setup --wipe _build --prefix={absolute-path} -Duse_mpi=false --buildtype=release` where `absolute-path` is the full path of the folder you want to install it in. You will have to add the `Lib\site-packages` directory within this to your PATH environment variable to make `moose` module visible to Python.*

This will create `moose` module inside `moose-core/_build_install` directory. To make moose importable from any terminal, add this directory to your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable. 

Meson provides many builtin options: https://mesonbuild.com/Builtin-options.html. Meson options are supplied in the command line to `meson setup` in the format `-Doption=value`.

  - **Buildtype**
	If you want a developement build with debug enabled, pass `-Dbuildtype=debug` in the `meson setup`.


	```
	meson setup --wipe _build --prefix=%CD%\\_build_install -Duse_mpi=false -Dbuildtype=debug  --vsenv
	```

	You can either use `buildtype` option alone or use the two options `debug` and `optimization` for finer grained control over the build. According to `meson` documentation `-Dbuildtype=debug` will create a debug build with optimization level 0 (i.e., no optimization, passing `-O0 -g` to GCC), `-Dbuildtype=debugoptimized`  will create a debug build with optimization level 2 (equivalent to `-Ddebug=true -Doptimization=2`), `-Dbuildtype=release` will create a release build with optimization level 3 (equivalent to `-Ddebug=false -Doptimization=3`), and `-Dbuildtype=minsize` will create a release build with space optimization (passing `-Os` to GCC).
	
  - **Optimization level**
	
	To set optimization level, pass `-Doptimization=level`, where level can be `plain`, `0`, `g`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `s`.


## Note on Debug build on Windows
Debug build tries to link with debug build of Python, and this is not
readily available on Windows, unless you build the Python interpreter
(CPython) itself from sources in debug mode. Therefore, debug build of
moose will fail at the linking stage complaining that the linker could
not find `python3x_d.lib`.

The workaround, as pointed out by Ali Ramezani
[here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66162568/lnk1104cannot-open-file-python39-d-lib),
is to make a copy of `python3x.lib` named `python3x_d.lib` in the same
directory (`libs`). After that, you can run meson setup as follows:

```
meson setup --wipe _build --prefix=%CD%\\_build_install -Duse_mpi=false --buildtype=debug --vsenv
```

and then go through the rest of the steps.

A free graphical debugger available for MS Windows is WinDbg (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/). You can
use it to attach to a running Python process and set breakpoints at
target function/line etc.

In WinDbg command line you find the moose module name with

```
lm m _moose*
```

The will show something like `_moose_cp311_win_amd64` when your build produced `_moose.cp311-win_amd64.lib`.

Now you can set a breakpoint to a class function with the module name as prefix as follows:

```
bp _moose_cp311_win_amd64!ChanBase::setGbar
```
