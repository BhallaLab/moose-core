/**
 * This class handles connections. Connections are the underlying
 * linkages upon which messages run: they are like wires, bidirectional.
 * Mutiple messages can run on any given wire.
 * An array of Conns is present in each SimpleElement, 
 * to enable bidirectional traversal of messages.
 *
 * The Conn structure has two design requirements: 
 * First, it must provide complete traversability in either direction.
 * This is achieved because we can identify the remote Conn with the
 * combination of Element* and target index. With a little more work
 * involving lookup of matching indices on the Element, we can also
 * identify the remote MsgDest or MsgSrc.
 * Second, it must provide complete information for the RecvFunc
 * that handles message operations on the destination object. 
 * Most RecvFuncs operate only on the Element*, but some need to know
 * their own index (which is the target index). Some need to go back
 * to the originating object, which involves looking up the matching
 * Conn on the target Element.
 *
 * \todo We need to provide a range of functions to handle changing
 * of target Elements, or reindexing following changes in the target
 * array of Conns.
