//This class deals with ion channels which can be found in one of multiple 
//states, some of which are conducting. This implementation assumes the 
//occurence of first order kinetics to calculate the probabilities of the
//channel of being found in all states. Further, the rates of transition 
//between these states can be constant, voltage-dependent, ligand dependent 
//(only one ligand species) or both. The current flow obtained from the channel
//is calculated in a deterministic method by solving the system of
//differential equations obtained from the assumptions above.
//The implicit assumption is that there are a number of ion channels present in
//the system. */
