Description: MOOSE is the Multiscale Object-Oriented Simulation Environment.
 It is the base and numerical core for large, detailed simulations including Computational Neuroscience and Systems Biology.
 .
 MOOSE spans the range from single molecules to subcellular networks, from
 single cells to neuronal networks, and to still larger systems.  MOOSE uses
 Python for scripting compatibility with a large range of software and
 analysis tools. It recognizes model definition standards including SBML,
 NeuroML, and GENESIS model file formatsGallery
 .
 MOOSE is open source software, licensed under the LGPL (Lesser GNU Public
 License). It has absolutely no warranty.
 .
 The MOOSE team is also participating in development of MOOGLI: a library and
 standalone application for displaying time-course of activity of detailed 3-D
 network models using OpenGL and also using OpenSceneGraph

Description: Visualizer for neural simulator
 .
 Moogli (a sister project of MOOSE) is a simulator independent openGL based
 visualization tool for neural simulations. Moogli can visualize morphology of
 single/multiple neurons or network of neurons, and can also visualize activity
 in these cells. 

Package: moose-doc
Architecture: any
Description: User and developer documents of MOOSE neural simulator.
 .
 This package installs user-manuals, tutorials, and developer document of MOOSE simulator.
