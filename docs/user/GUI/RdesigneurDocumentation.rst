Introduction
------------

**Rdesigneur** (Reaction Diffusion and Electrical SIGnaling in NEURons)
is an interface to the multiscale modeling capabilities in MOOSE. It is
designed to build models incorporating biochemical signaling pathways in
dendrites and spines, coupled to electrical events in neurons.
Rdesigneur assembles models from predefined parts: it delegates the
details to specialized model definition formats. Rdesigneur combines one
or more of the following cell parts to build models:

-  Neuronal morphology
-  Dendritic spines
-  Ion channels
-  Reaction systems

Rdesigneur's main role is to specify how these are put together,
including assigning parameters to do so. Rdesigneur also helps with
setting up the simulation input and output.

Quick Start
-----------

Here we provide a few use cases, building up from a minimal model to a
reasonably complete multiscale model spanning chemical and electrical
signaling.

Bare Rdesigneur: single passive compartment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If we don't provide any arguments at all to the Rdesigneur, it makes a
model with a single passive electrical compartment in the MOOSE path
``/model/elec/soma``. Here is how to do this:

::

    import moose
    import rdesigneur as rd
    rdes = rd.rdesigneur()
    rdes.buildModel()

To confirm that it has made a compartment with some default values we
can add a line:

::

    moose.showfields( rdes.soma )

This should produce the output:

::

    [ /model[0]/elec[0]/soma[0] ]
    diameter         = 0.0005
    fieldIndex       = 0
    Ra               = 7639437.26841
    y0               = 0.0
    Rm               = 424413.177334
    index            = 0
    numData          = 1
    inject           = 0.0
    initVm           = -0.065
    Em               = -0.0544
    y                = 0.0
    numField         = 1
    path             = /model[0]/elec[0]/soma[0]
    dt               = 0.0
    tick             = -2
    z0               = 0.0
    name             = soma
    Cm               = 7.85398163398e-09
    x0               = 0.0
    Vm               = -0.06
    className        = ZombieCompartment
    idValue          = 465
    length           = 0.0005
    Im               = 1.3194689277e-08
    x                = 0.0005
    z                = 0.0

Simulate and display current pulse to soma
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A more useful script would run and display the model. Rdesigneur can
help with the stimulus and the plotting. This simulation has the same
passive compartment, and current is injected as the simulation runs.
This script displays the membrane potential of the soma as it charges
and discharges.

::

    import moose
    import rdesigneur as rd
    rdes = rd.rdesigneur(
        stimList = [['soma', '1', 'inject', '(t>0.1 && t<0.2) * 2e-8']],
        plotList = [['soma', '1', 'Vm', 'Soma membrane potential']],
    )
    rdes.buildModel()
    moose.reinit()
    moose.start( 0.3 )
    rdes.display()

The *stimList* defines a stimulus. Each entry has four arguments:

::

    `[region_in_cell, region_expression, parameter, expression_string]`

-  ``region_in_cell`` specifies the objects to stimulate. Here it is
   just the soma.
-  ``region_expression`` specifies a geometry based calculation to
   decide whether to apply the stimulus. The value must be >0 for the
   stimulus to be present. Here it is just 1.
-  ``parameter`` specifies the simulation parameter to assign. Here it
   is the injection current to the compartment.
-  ``expression_string`` calculates the value of the parameter,
   typically as a function of time. Here we use the function sign(x),
   where sign(x) == +1 for x > 0, 0 for x = 0 and -1 for x < 0.

To summarise this, the *stimList* here means *inject a current of 20nA
to the soma between the times of 0.1 and 0.2 s*.

The *plotList* defines what to plot. It has a similar set of arguments:

::

    `[region_in_cell, region_expression, parameter, title_of_plot]`

These mean the same thing as for the stimList except for the title of
the plot.

The *rdes.display()* function causes the plots to be displayed.

When we run this we see an initial depolarization as the soma settles
from its initial -65 mV to a resting Em = -54.4 mV. These are the
original HH values, see the example above. At t = 0.1 seconds there is
another depolarization due to the current injection, and at t = 0.2
seconds this goes back to the resting potential.

HH Squid model in a single compartment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here we put the Hodgkin-Huxley squid model channels into a passive
compartment. The HH channels are predefined as prototype channels for
Rdesigneur,

::

    import moose
    import pylab
    import rdesigneur as rd
    rdes = rd.rdesigneur(
        chanProto = [['make_HH_Na()', 'Na'], ['make_HH_K()', 'K']],
        chanDistrib = [
            ['Na', 'soma', 'Gbar', '1200' ],
            ['K', 'soma', 'Gbar', '360' ]],
        stimList = [['soma', '1', 'inject', '(t>0.1 && t<0.2) * 1e-8' ]],
        plotList = [['soma', '1', 'Vm', 'Membrane potential']]
    )

    rdes.buildModel()
    moose.reinit()
    moose.start( 0.3 )
    rdes.display()

Here we introduce two new model specification lines:

-  **chanProto**: This specifies which ion channels will be used in the
   model. Each entry here has two fields: the source of the channel
   definition, and (optionally) the name of the channel. In this example
   we specify two channels, an Na and a K channel using the original
   Hodgkin-Huxley parameters. As the source of the channel definition we
   use the name of the Python function that builds the channel. The
   *make\_HH\_Na()* and *make\_HH\_K()* functions are predefined but we
   can also specify our own functions for making prototypes. We could
   also have specified the channel prototype using the name of a channel
   definition file in ChannelML (a subset of NeuroML) format.
-  **chanDistrib**: This specifies *where* the channels should be placed
   over the geometry of the cell. Each entry in the chanDistrib list
   specifies the distribution of parameters for one channel using four
   entries:

   ``[object_name, region_in_cell, parameter, expression_string]``

   In this case the job is almost trivial, since we just have a single
   compartment named *soma*. So the line

   ``['Na', 'soma', 'Gbar', '1200' ]``

   means *Put the Na channel in the soma, and set its maximal
   conductance density (Gbar) to 1200 Siemens/m^2*.

As before we apply a somatic current pulse. Since we now have HH
channels in the model, this generates action potentials.

Reaction system in a single compartment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here we use the compartment as a place in which to embed a chemical
model. The chemical oscillator model is predefined in the rdesigneur
prototypes.

::

    import moose
    import pylab
    import rdesigneur as rd
    rdes = rd.rdesigneur(
            turnOffElec = True,
            diffusionLength = 1e-3, # Default diffusion length is 2 microns
            chemProto = [['make_Chem_Oscillator()', 'osc']],
            chemDistrib = [['osc', 'soma', 'install', '1' ]],
            plotList = [['soma', '1', 'dend/a', 'conc', 'a Conc'],
                ['soma', '1', 'dend/b', 'conc', 'b Conc']]
    )
    rdes.buildModel()
    b = moose.element( '/model/chem/dend/b' )
    b.concInit *= 5
    moose.reinit()
    moose.start( 200 )

    rdes.display()

In this special case we set the turnOffElec flag to True, so that
Rdesigneur only sets up chemical and not electrical calculations. This
makes the calculations much faster, since we disable electrical
calculations and delink chemical calculations from them.

We also have a line which sets the ``diffusionLength`` to 1 mm, so that
it is bigger than the 0.5 mm squid axon segment in the default
compartment. If you don't do this the system will subdivide the
compartment into 2 micron voxels for the purposes of putting in a
reaction-diffusion system, which we discuss below.

There are a couple of lines to change the initial concentration of the
molecular pool b. It is scaled up 5x to give rise to slowly decaying
oscillations.

.. figure:: ../../images/rdes4_osc.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Plot for single-compartment reaction simulation

   Plot for single-compartment reaction simulation
Reaction-diffusion system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to see what a reaction-diffusion system looks like, delete the
``diffusionLength`` expression in the previous example and add a couple
of lines to set up 3-D graphics for the reaction-diffusion product:

::

    import moose
    import pylab
    import rdesigneur as rd
    rdes = rd.rdesigneur(
            turnOffElec = True,
            chemProto = [['make_Chem_Oscillator()', 'osc']],
            chemDistrib = [['osc', 'soma', 'install', '1' ]],
            plotList = [['soma', '1', 'dend/a', 'conc', 'Concentration of a'],
                ['soma', '1', 'dend/b', 'conc', 'Concentration of b']],
            moogList = [['soma', '1', 'dend/a', 'conc', 'a Conc', 0, 360 ]]
    )

    rdes.buildModel()
    bv = moose.vec( '/model/chem/dend/b' )
    bv[0].concInit *= 2
    bv[-1].concInit *= 2
    moose.reinit()

    rdes.displayMoogli( 1, 400, 0.001 )

This is the line we deleted.

::

        `diffusionLength = 1e-3,`

With this change we permit *rdesigneur* to use the default diffusion
length of 2 microns. The 500-micron axon segment is now subdivided into
250 voxels, each of which has a reaction system and diffusing molecules.
To make it more picturesque, we have added a line after the plotList, to
display the outcome in 3-D:

::

    'moogList = [['soma', '1', 'dend/a', 'conc', 'a Conc', 0, 360 ]]'

This line says: take the model compartments defined by ``soma`` as the
region to display, do so throughout the the geometry (the ``1``
signifies this), and over this range find the chemical entity defined by
``dend/a``. For each ``a`` molecule, find the ``conc`` and dsiplay it.
There are two optional arguments, ``0`` and ``360``, which specify the
low and high value of the displayed variable.

In order to initially break the symmetry of the system, we change the
initial concentration of molecule b at each end of the cylinder:

::

    bv[0].concInit *= 2
    bv[-1].concInit *= 2

If we didn't do this the entire system would go through a few cycles of
decaying oscillation and then reach a boring, spatially uniform, steady
state. Try putting an initial symmetry break elsewhere to see what
happens.

To display the concenctration changes in the 3-D soma as the simulation
runs, we use the line

::

    `rdes.displayMoogli( 1, 400, 0.001 )`

The arguments mean: *displayMoogli( frametime, runtime, rotation )*
Here,

::

    frametime = time by which simulation advances between display updates
    runtime = Total simulated time
    rotation = angle by which display rotates in each frame, in radians.

When we run this, we first get a 3-D display with the oscillating
reaction-diffusion system making its way inward from the two ends. After
the simulation ends the plots for all compartments for the whole run
come up.

Primer on using the 3-D MOOGLI display
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a short primer on the 3-D display controls.

-  *Roll, pitch, and yaw*: Use the letters *r*, *p*, and *y*. To rotate
   backwards, use capitals.
-  *Zoom out and in*: Use the *,* and *.* keys, or their upper-case
   equivalents, *<* and *>*. Easier to remember if you think in terms of
   the upper-case.
-  *Left/right/up/down*: Arrow keys.
-  *Quit*: control-q or control-w.
-  You can also use the mouse or trackpad to control most of the above.
-  By default rdesigneur gives Moogli a small rotation each frame. It is
   the *rotation* argument in the line:

   ``displayMoogli( frametime, runtime, rotation )``

These controls operate over and above this rotation, but the rotation
continues. If you set the rotation to zero you can, with a suitable
flick of the mouse, get the image to rotate in any direction you choose
as long as the window is updating.

Make a toy multiscale model with electrical and chemical signaling.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we put together chemical and electrical models. In this toy model we
have an HH-squid type single compartment electrical model, cohabiting
with a chemical oscillator. The chemical oscillator regulates K+ channel
amounts, and the average membrane potential regulates the amounts of a
reactant in the chemical oscillator. This is a recipe for some strange
firing patterns.

::

    import moose
    import pylab
    import rdesigneur as rd
    rdes = rd.rdesigneur(
            # We want just one compartment so we set diffusion length to be
            # bigger than the 0.5 mm HH axon compartment default. 
                diffusionLength = 1e-3,
                chanProto = [['make_HH_Na()', 'Na'], ['make_HH_K()', 'K']],
                chanDistrib = [
                    ['Na', 'soma', 'Gbar', '1200' ],
                    ['K', 'soma', 'Gbar', '360' ]],
            chemProto = [['make_Chem_Oscillator()', 'osc']],
            chemDistrib = [['osc', 'soma', 'install', '1' ]],
            # These adaptor parameters give interesting-looking but
            # not particularly physiological behaviour.
            adaptorList = [
                [ 'dend/a', 'conc', 'Na', 'modulation', 1, -5.0 ],
                [ 'dend/b', 'conc', 'K', 'modulation', 1, -0.2],
                [ 'dend/b', 'conc', '.', 'inject', -1.0e-7, 4e-7 ],
                [ '.', 'Vm', 'dend/s', 'conc', 2.5, 20.0 ]
            ],
            plotList = [['soma', '1', 'dend/a', 'conc', 'a Conc'],
                ['soma', '1', 'dend/b', 'conc', 'b Conc'],
                ['soma', '1', 'dend/s', 'conc', 's Conc'],
                ['soma', '1', 'Na', 'Gk', 'Na Gk'],
                ['soma', '1', '.', 'Vm', 'Membrane potential']
        ]
    )

    rdes.buildModel()
    moose.reinit()
    moose.start( 250 ) # Takes a few seconds to run this.

    rdes.display()

We've already modeled the HH squid model and the oscillator
individually, and you should recognize the parts of those models above.
The new section that makes this work the *adaptorList* which specifies
how the electrical and chemical parts talk to each other. This entirely
fictional set of interactions goes like this:

::

    [ 'dend/a', 'conc', 'Na', 'modulation', 1, -5.0 ]

-  *dend/a*: The originating variable comes from the 'a' pool on the
   'dend' compartment.

   *conc*: This is the originating variable name on the 'a' pool.

   *Na*: This is the target variable

   *modulation*: scale the Gbar of Na up and down. Use 'modulation'
   rather than direct assignment of Gbar since Gbar is different for
   each differently-sized compartment.

   *1*: This is the initial offset

   *-5.0*: This is the scaling from the input to the parameter updated
   in the simulation.

A similar set of adaptor entries couple the molecule *dend/b* to the K
channel, *dend/b* again to the current injection into the soma, and the
membrane potential to the concentration of *dend/s*.

Morphology: Load .swc morphology file and view it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here we build a passive model using a morphology file in the .swc file
format (as used by NeuroMorpho.org). The morphology file is predefined
for Rdesigneur and resides in the directory ``./cells``. We apply a
somatic current pulse, and view the somatic membrane potential in a
plot, as before. To make things interesting we display the morphology in
3-D upon which we represent the membrane potential as colors.

::

    import moose
    import rdesigneur as rd
    rdes = rd.rdesigneur(
        cellProto = [['./cells/h10.CNG.swc', 'elec']],
        stimList = [['soma', '1', '.', 'inject', 't * 25e-9' ]], 
        plotList = [['#', '1', '.', 'Vm', 'Membrane potential'],
            ['#', '1', 'Ca_conc', 'Ca', 'Ca conc (uM)']],
        moogList = [['#', '1', '.', 'Vm', 'Soma potential']]
    )

    rdes.buildModel()

    moose.reinit()
    rdes.displayMoogli( 0.0002, 0.1 )

Here the new concept is the cellProto line, which loads in the specified
cell model:

::

    `[ filename, cellname ]`

The system recognizes the filename extension and builds a model from the
swc file. It uses the cellname **elec** in this example.

We use a similar line as in the reaction-diffusion example, to build up
a Moogli display of the cell model:

::

    `moogList = [['#', '1', '.', 'Vm', 'Soma potential']]`

Here we have:

::

    *#*: the path to use for selecting the compartments to display. 
    This wildcard means use all compartments.
    *1*: The expression to use for the compartments. Again, `1` means use
    all of them.
    *.*: Which object in the compartment to display. Here we are using the
    compartment itself, so it is just a dot.
    *Vm*: Field to display
    *Soma potential*: Title for display.

Build an active neuron model by putting channels into a morphology file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We load in a morphology file and distribute voltage-gated ion channels
over the neuron. Here the voltage-gated channels are obtained from a
number of channelML files, located in the ``./channels`` subdirectory.
Since we have a spatially extended neuron, we need to specify the
spatial distribution of channel densities too.

    )

    rdes.buildModel()

    moose.reinit()
    rdes.displayMoogli( 0.0002, 0.052 )

Here we make more extensive use of two concepts which we've already seen
from the single compartment squid model:

1. *chanProto*: This defines numerous channels, each of which is of the
   form:

   ``[ filename ]``

   or

   ``[ filename, channelname ]``

If the *channelname* is not specified the system uses the last part of
the channel name, before the filetype suffix.

2. *chanDistrib*: This defines the spatial distribution of each channel
   type. Each line is of a form that should be familiar now:

   ``[channelname, region_in_cell, parameter, expression_string]``

-  The *channelname* is the name of the prototype from *chanproto*. This
   is usually an ion channel, but in the example above you can also see
   a calcium concentration pool defined.
-  The *region\_in\_cell* is typically defined using wildcards, so that
   it generalizes to any cell morphology. For example, the plain
   wildcard ``#`` means to consider all cell compartments. The wildcard
   ``#dend#`` means to consider all compartments with the string
   ``dend`` somewhere in the name. Wildcards can be comma-separated, so
   ``#soma#,#dend#`` means consider all compartments with either soma or
   dend in their name. The naming in MOOSE is defined by the model file.
   Importantly, in **.swc** files MOOSE generates names that respect the
   classification of compartments into axon, soma, dendrite, and apical
   dendrite compartments respectively. SWC files generate compartment
   names such as:

   ::

       soma_<number>
       dend_<number>
       apical_<number>
       axon_<number>

where the number is automatically assigned by the reader. In order to
select all dendritic compartments, for example, one would use *"#dend#"*
where the *"#"* acts as a wildcard to accept any string. - The
*parameter* is usually Gbar, the channel conductance density in *S/m^2*.
If *Gbar* is zero or less, then the system economizes by not
incorporating this channel mechanism in this part of the cell.
Similarly, for calcium pools, if the *tau* is below zero then the
calcium pool object is simply not inserted into this part of the cell. -
The *expression\_string* defines the value of the parameter, such as
Gbar. This is typically a function of position in the cell. The
expression evaluator knows about several parameters of cell geometry.
All units are in metres:

-  *x*, *y* and *z* coordinates.
-  *g*, the geometrical distance from the soma
-  *p*, the path length from the soma, measured along the dendrites.
-  *dia*, the diameter of the dendrite.
-  *L*, The electrotonic length from the soma (no units).

Along with these geometrical arguments, we make liberal use of the
Heaviside function H(x) to set up the channel distributions. The
expression evaluator also knows about pretty much all common algebraic,
trignometric, and logarithmic functions, should you wish to use these.

Also note the two Moogli displays. The first is the calcium
concentration. The second is the membrane potential in each compartment.
Easy!

Build a spiny neuron from a morphology file and put active channels in it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This model is one step elaborated from the previous one, in that we now
also have dendritic spines. MOOSE lets one decorate a bare neuronal
morphology file with dendritic spines, specifying various geometric
parameters of their location. As before, we use an swc file for the
morphology, and the same ion channels and distribution.

Spines are set up in a familiar way: we first define one (or more)
prototype spines, and then distribute these around the cell. Here is the
prototype string:

::

        [spine_proto, spinename]

*spine\_proto*: This is typically a function. One can define one's own,
but there are several predefined ones in rdesigneur. All these define a
spine with the following parameters:

-  head diameter 0.5 microns
-  head length 0.5 microns
-  shaft length 1 micron
-  shaft diameter of 0.2 microns
-  RM = 1.0 ohm-metre square
-  RA = 1.0 ohm-meter
-  CM = 0.01 Farads per square metre.

Here are the predefined spine prototypes:

-  *make\_passive\_spine()*: This just makes a passive spine with the
   default parameters
-  *make\_exc\_spine()*: This makes a spine with NMDA and glu receptors,
   and also a calcium pool. The NMDA channel feeds the Ca pool.
-  *make\_active\_spine()*: This adds a Ca channel to the exc\_spine.
   and also a calcium pool.

The spine distributions are specified in a familiar way for the first
few arguments, and then there are multiple (optional) spine-specific
parameters:

*[spinename, region\_in\_cell, spacing, spacing\_distrib, size,
size\_distrib, angle, angle\_distrib ]*

Only the first two arguments are mandatory.

-  *spinename*: The prototype name
-  *region\_in\_cell*: Usual wildcard specification of names of
   compartments in which to put the spines.
-  *spacing*: Math expression to define spacing between spines. In the
   current implementation this evaluates to
   ``1/probability_of_spine_per_unit_length``. Defaults to 10 microns.
   Thus, there is a 10% probability of a spine insertion in every
   micron. This evaluation method has the drawback that it is possible
   to space spines rather too close to each other. If spacing is zero or
   less, no spines are inserted.
-  *spacing\_distrib*: Math expression for distribution of spacing. In
   the current implementation, this specifies the interval at which the
   system samples from the spacing probability above. Defaults to 1
   micron.
-  *size*: Linear scale factor for size of spine. All dimensions are
   scaled by this factor. The default spine head here is 0.5 microns in
   diameter and length. If the scale factor were to be 2, the volume
   would be 8 times as large. Defaults to 1.0.
-  *size\_distrib*: Range for size of spine. A random number R is
   computed in the range 0 to 1, and the final size used is
   ``size + (R - 0.5) * size_distrib``. Defaults to 0.5
-  *angle*: This specifies the initial angle at which the spine sticks
   out of the dendrite. If all angles were zero, they would all point
   away from the soma. Defaults to 0 radians.
-  *angle\_distrib*: Specifies a random number to add to the initial
   angle. Defaults to 2 PI radians, so the spines come out in any
   direction.

One may well ask why we are not using a Python dictionary to handle all
these parameters. Short answer is: terseness. Longer answer is that the
rdesigneur format is itself meant to be an intermediate form for an
eventual high-level, possibly XML-based multiscale modeling format.

Build a spiny neuron from a morphology file and put a reaction-diffusion system in it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rdesigneur is specially designed to take reaction systems with a
dendrite, a spine head, and a spine PSD compartment, and embed these
systems into neuronal morphologies. This example shows how this is done.

The dendritic molecules diffuse along the dendrite in the region
specified by the *chemDistrib* keyword. In this case they are placed on
all apical and basal dendrites, but only at distances over 500 microns
from the soma. The spine head and PSD reaction systems are inserted only
into spines within this same *chemDistrib* zone. Diffusion coupling
between dendrite, and each spine head and PSD is also set up. It takes a
predefined chemical model file for Rdesigneur, which resides in the
``./chem`` subdirectory. As in an earlier example, we turn off the
electrical calculations here as they are not needed. Here we plot out
the number of receptors on every single spine as a function of time.
