# Introduction

This document describes how to use the `moose` module in Python
scripts or in an interactive Python shell. It aims to give you
enough overview to help you start scripting using MOOSE and extract
farther information that may be required for advanced work.
Knowledge of Python or programming in general will be helpful. If
you just want to simulate existing models in one of the supported
formats, you can fire the MOOSE GUI and locate the model file using
the `File` menu and load it. The GUI is described
[here](./MooseGuiDocs.html). The example code in the boxes can be
entered in a Python shell.

# Importing MOOSE and accessing built-in documentation

In a python script you import modules to access the functionalities
they provide.

~~~~{.python}
    import moose
~~~~

This makes the `moose` module available for use in Python. You can
use Python's built-in `help` function to read the top-level
documentation for the moose module:

~~~~{.python}
    help(moose)
~~~~

This will give you an overview of the module. Press `q` to exit
the pager and get back to the interpreter. You can also access the
documentation for individual classes and functions this way.

~~~~{.python}
    help(moose.connect)
~~~~

To list the available functions and classes you can use `dir`
function[^1].

~~~~{.python}
    dir(moose)
~~~~

MOOSE has built-in documentation in the C++-source-code independent
of Python. The `moose` module has a separate `doc` function to
extract this documentation.

~~~~{.python}
    moose.doc(moose.Compartment)
~~~~

The class level documentation will show whatever the
author/maintainer of the class wrote for documentation followed by
a list of various kinds of fields and their data types. This can be
very useful in an interactive session.

Each field can have its own detailed documentation, too.

~~~~{.python}
    moose.doc('Compartment.Rm')
~~~~

Note that you need to put the class-name followed by dot followed
by field-name within quotes. Otherwise, `moose.doc` will receive
the field value as parameter and get confused.

# Creating objects and traversing the object hierarchy

Different types of biological entities like neurons, enzymes, etc
are represented by classes and individual instances of those types
are objects of those classes. Objects are the building-blocks of
models in MOOSE. We call MOOSE objects `element` and use object
and element interchangeably in the context of MOOSE. Elements are
conceptually laid out in a tree-like hierarchical structure. If you
are familiar with file system hierarchies in common operating
systems, this should be simple.

At the top of the object hierarchy sits the `Shell`, equivalent to
the root directory in UNIX-based systems and represented by the
path `/`. You can list the existing objects under `/` using the
`le` function.

~~~~{.python}
    moose.le()
~~~~

This shows something like:

~~~~{.python}
    Elements under /
    /Msgs
    /clock
    /classes
~~~~

`Msgs`, `clock` and `classes` are predefined objects in
MOOSE. And each object can contain other objects inside them. You
can see them by passing the path of the parent object to `le`.

Entering:

~~~~{.python}
    moose.le('/clock')
~~~~

prints:

~~~~{.python}
    Elements under /clock
    /clock/tick[0]
~~~~

Now let us create some objects of our own. This can be done by
invoking MOOSE class constructors (just like regular Python
classes).

~~~~{.python}
    model = moose.Neutral('/model')
~~~~

The above creates a `Neutral` object named `model`. `Neutral` is
the most basic class in MOOSE. A `Neutral` element can act as a
container for other elements. We can create something under
`model`:

~~~~{.python}
    soma = moose.Compartment('/model/soma')
~~~~

Every element has a unique path. This is a concatenation of the
names of all the objects one has to traverse starting with the root
to reach that element.

~~~~{.python}
    print soma.path
~~~~

shows you its path:

~~~~{.python}
    /model/soma
~~~~

The name of the element can be printed, too.

~~~~{.python}
    print soma.name
~~~~

shows:

~~~~{.python}
    soma
~~~~

The `Compartment` elements model small portions of a neuron. Some
basic experiments can be carried out using a single compartment.
Let us create another object to act on the `soma`. This will be a
step current generator to inject a current pulse into the soma.

~~~~{.python}
    pulse = moose.PulseGen('/model/pulse')
~~~~

You can use `le` at any point to see what is there:

~~~~{.python}
    moose.le('/model')
~~~~

will show you:

~~~~{.python}
    Elements under /model
    /model/soma
    /model/pulse
~~~~

And finally, we can create a `Table` to record the time series of
the soma's membrane potential. It is good practice to organize the
data separately from the model. So we do it as below:

~~~~{.python}
    data = moose.Neutral('/data')
    vmtab = moose.Table('/data/soma_Vm')
~~~~

Now that we have the essential elements for a small model, we can
go on to set the properties of this model and the experimental
protocol.

# Setting the properties of elements: accessing fields

Elements have several kinds of fields. The simplest ones are the
`value fields`. These can be accessed like ordinary Python members.
You can list the available value fields using `getFieldNames`
function:

~~~~{.python}
    soma.getFieldNames('valueFinfo')
~~~~

Here `valueFinfo` is the type name for value fields. `Finfo` is
short form of *field information*. For each type of field there is
a name ending with `-Finfo`. The above will display the following
list:

~~~~{.python}
     ('this',
    'name',
    'me',
    'parent',
    'children',
    'path',
    'class',
    'linearSize',
    'objectDimensions',
    'lastDimension',
    'localNumField',
    'pathIndices',
    'msgOut',
    'msgIn',
    'Vm',
    'Cm',
    'Em',
    'Im',
    'inject',
    'initVm',
    'Rm',
    'Ra',
    'diameter',
    'length',
    'x0',
    'y0',
    'z0',
    'x',
    'y',
    'z')
~~~~

Some of these fields are for internal or advanced use, some give
access to the physical properties of the biological entity we are
trying to model. Now we are interested in `Cm`, `Rm`, `Em` and
`initVm`. In the most basic form, a neuronal compartment acts like
a parallel `RC` circuit with a battery attached. Here `R` and `C`
are resistor and capacitor connected in parallel, and the battery
with voltage `Em` is in series with the resistor, as shown below:

----

![**Passive neuronal compartment**](../../images/neuronalcompartment.jpg)

----

The fields are populated with some defaults.

~~~~{.python}
    print soma.Cm, soma.Rm, soma.Vm, soma.Em, soma.initVm
~~~~

will give you:

~~~~{.python}
    1.0 1.0 -0.06 -0.06 -0.06
~~~~

You can set the `Cm` and `Rm` fields to something realistic using
simple assignment (we follow SI unit)[^2].

~~~~{.python}
    soma.Cm = 1e-9
    soma.Rm = 1e7
    soma.initVm = -0.07
~~~~

Instead of writing print statements for each field, you could use
the utility function showfield to see that the changes took
effect:

~~~~{.python}
    moose.showfield(soma)
~~~~

will list most of the fields with their values:

~~~~{.c}
    [ /model/soma ]
    diameter             = 0.0
    linearSize           = 1
    localNumField        = 0
    Ra                   = 1.0
    y0                   = 0.0
    Rm                   = 10000000.0
    inject               = 0.0
    Em                   = -0.06
    initVm               = -0.07
    x                    = 0.0
    path                 = /model/soma
    x0                   = 0.0
    z0                   = 0.0
    class                = Compartment
    name                 = soma
    Cm                   = 1e-09
    Vm                   = -0.06
    length               = 0.0
    Im                   = 0.0
    y                    = 0.0
    lastDimension        = 0
    z                    = 0.0
~~~~{.python}

Now we can setup the current pulse to be delivered to the soma:

~~~~{.python}
    pulse.delay[0] = 50e-3
    pulse.width[0] = 100e-3
    pulse.level[0] = 1e-9
    pulse.delay[1] = 1e9
~~~~

This tells the pulse generator to create a 100 ms long pulse 50 ms
after the start of the simulation. The amplitude of the pulse is
set to 1 nA. We set the delay for the next pulse to a very large
value (larger than the total simulation time) so that the
stimulation stops after the first pulse. Had we set
`pulse.delay = 0` , it would have generated a pulse train at 50 ms
intervals.

# Putting them together: setting up connections

In order for the elements to interact during simulation, we need to
connect them via messages. Elements are connected to each other
using special source and destination fields. These types are named
`srcFinfo` and `destFinfo`. You can query the available source and
destination fields on an element using `getFieldNames` as before.
This time, let us do it another way: by the class name:

~~~~{.python}
    moose.getFieldNames('PulseGen', 'srcFinfo')
~~~~

This form has the advantage that you can get information about a
class without creating elements of that class. The above code
shows:

~~~~{.python}
    ('childMsg', 'outputOut')
~~~~

Here `childMsg` is a source field that is used by the MOOSE
internals to connect child elements to parent elements. The second
one is of our interest. Check out the built-in documentation here:

~~~~{.python}
    moose.doc('PulseGen.outputOut')
~~~~

shows:

~~~~{.python}
    PulseGen.outputOut: double - source field
          Current output level.
~~~~

so this is the output of the pulse generator and this must be
injected into the `soma` to stimulate it. But where in the `soma`
can we send it? Again, MOOSE has some introspection built in.

~~~~{.python}
    soma.getFieldNames('destFinfo')
~~~~

shows:

~~~~{.python}
    ('parentMsg',
     'set_this',
     'get_this',
       ...
     'set_z',
     'get_z',
     'injectMsg',
     'randInject',
     'cable',
     'process',
     'reinit',
     'initProc',
     'initReinit',
     'handleChannel',
     'handleRaxial',
     'handleAxial')
~~~~

Now that is a long list. But much of it are fields for internal or
special use. Anything that starts with `get_` or `set_` are
internal `destFinfo` used for accessing value fields (we shall use
one of those when setting up data recording). Among the rest
`injectMsg` seems to be the most likely candidate. Use the
`connect` function to connect the pulse generator output to the
soma input:

~~~~{.python}
    m = moose.connect(pulse, 'outputOut', soma, 'injectMsg')
~~~~

`connect(source, source_field, dest, dest_field)` creates a
`message` from `source` element's `source_field` field to `dest`
elements `dest_field` field and returns that message. Messages are
also elements. You can print them to see their identity:

~~~~{.python}
    print m
~~~~

on my system gives:

~~~~{.python}
    <moose.SingleMsg: id=5, dataId=733, path=/Msgs/singleMsg[733]>
~~~~

You can print any element as above and the string representation
will show you the class, two numbers(`id` and `dataId`) uniquely
identifying it among all elements, and its path. You can get some
more information about a message:

~~~~{.python}
    print m.e1.path, m.e2.path, m.srcFieldsOnE1, m.destFieldsOnE2
~~~~

will confirm what you already know:

~~~~{.python}
    /model/pulse /model/soma ('outputOut',) ('injectMsg',)
~~~~

A message element has fields `e1` and `e2` referring to the
elements it connects. For single one-directional messages these are
source and destination elements, which are `pulse` and `soma`
respectively. The next two items are lists of the field names which
are connected by this message.

You could also check which elements are connected to a particular
field:

~~~~{.python}
    print soma.neighbours['injectMsg']
~~~~

shows:

~~~~{.python}
    [<moose.ematrix: class=PulseGen, id=729,path=/model/pulse>]
~~~~

Notice that the list contains something called ematrix. We discuss
this [later](#some-more-details). Also `neighbours` is a new kind of field:
`lookupFinfo` which behaves like a dictionary. Next we connect the
table to the soma to retrieve its membrane potential `Vm`. This is
where all those `destFinfo` starting with `get_` or `set_` come in
use. For each value field `X`, there is a `destFinfo` `get_{X}`
to retrieve the value at simulation time. This is used by the table
to record the values `Vm` takes.

~~~~{.python}
    moose.connect(vmtab, 'requestData', soma, 'get_Vm')
~~~~

This finishes our model and recording setup. You might be wondering
about the source-destination relationship above. It is natural to
think that `soma` is the source of `Vm` values which should be sent
to `vmtab`. But here `requestData` is a `srcFinfo` acting like a
reply card. This mode of obtaining data is called *pull*
mode.[^3]

# Scheduling and running the simulation

With the model all set up, we have to schedule the simulation.
MOOSE has a central clock element (`/clock`) to manage time. Clock
has a set of `Tick` elements under it that take care of advancing
the state of each element with time as the simulation progresses.
Every element to be included in a simulation must be assigned a
tick. Each tick can have a different ticking interval (`dt`) that
allows different elements to be updated at different rates. We
initialize the ticks and set their `dt` values using the `setClock`
function.

~~~~{.python}
    moose.setClock(0, 0.025e-3)
    moose.setClock(1, 0.025e-3)
    moose.setClock(2, 0.25e-3)
~~~~

This will initialize tick #0 and tick #1 with `dt = 25` μs and tick
#2 with `dt = 250` μs. Thus all the elements scheduled on ticks
#0 and 1 will be updated every 25 μs and those on tick #2
every 250 μs. We use the faster clocks for the model components
where finer timescale is required for numerical accuracy and the
slower clock to sample the values of `Vm`.

So to assign tick #2 to the table for recording `Vm`, we pass its
whole path to the `useClock` function.

~~~~{.python}
    moose.useClock(2, '/data/soma_Vm', 'process')
~~~~

Read this as "use tick # 2 on the element at path `/data/soma_Vm`
to call its `process` method at every step". Every class that is
supposed to update its state or take some action during simulation
implements a `process` method. And in most cases that is the method
we want the ticks to call at every time step. A less common method
is `init`, which is implemented in some classes to interleave
actions or updates that must be executed in a specific
order[^4]. The `Compartment` class is one such case where
a neuronal compartment has to know the `Vm` of its neighboring
compartments before it can calculate its `Vm` for the next step.
This is done with:

~~~~{.python}
    moose.useClock(0, soma.path, 'init')
~~~~

Here we used the `path` field instead of writing the path
explicitly.

Next we assign tick #1 to process method of everything under
`/model`.

~~~~{.python}
    moose.useClock(1, '/model/##', 'process')
~~~~

Here the second argument is an example of wild-card path. The `##`
matches everything under the path preceding it at any depth. Thus
if we had some other objects under `/model/soma`, `process` method
of those would also have been scheduled on tick #1. This is very
useful for complex models where it is tedious to scheduled each
element individually. In this case we could have used `/model/#` as
well for the path. This is a single level wild-card which matches
only the children of `/model` but does not go farther down in the
hierarchy.

Once the elements are assigned ticks, we can put the model to its
initial state using:

~~~~{.python}
    moose.reinit()
~~~~

You may remember that we had changed initVm from `-0.06` to `-0.07`.
The reinit call we initialize `Vm` to that value. You can verify
that:

~~~~{.python}
    print soma.Vm
~~~~

gives:

~~~~{.python}
    -0.07
~~~~

Finally, we run the simulation for 300 ms:

~~~~{.python}
    moose.start(300e-3)
~~~~

The data will be recorded by the `soma_vm` table, which is
referenced by the variable `vmtab`. The `Table` class provides a
numpy array interface to its content. The field is `vec`. So you
can easily plot the membrane potential using the
[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) library.

~~~~{.python}
    import pylab
    t = pylab.linspace(0, 300e-3, len(vmtab.vec))
    pylab.plot(t, vmtab.vec)
    pylab.show()
~~~~

The first line imports the pylab submodule from matplotlib. This
useful for interactive plotting. The second line creates the time
points to match our simulation time and length of the recorded
data. The third line plots the `Vm` and the fourth line makes it
visible. Does the plot match your expectation?

# Some more details

## `ematrix`, `melement` and `element`

MOOSE elements are instances of the class `melement`.
`Compartment`, `PulseGen` and other MOOSE classes are derived
classes of `melement`. All `melement` instances are contained in
array-like structures called `ematrix`. Each `ematrix` object has a
numerical `id_` field uniquely identifying it. An `ematrix` can
have one or more elements. You can create an array of elements:

~~~~{.python}
    comp_array = moose.ematrix('/model/comp', (3,), 'Compartment')
~~~~

This tells MOOSE to create an `ematrix` of 3 `Compartment` elements
with path `/model/comp`. For `ematrix` objects with multiple
elements, the index in the `ematrix` is part of the element path.

~~~~{.python}
    print comp_array.path, type(comp_array)
~~~~

shows that `comp_array` is an instance of `ematrix` class. You can
loop through the elements in an `ematrix` like a Python list:

~~~~{.python}
    for comp in comp_array:
        print comp.path, type(comp)
~~~~

shows:

~~~~{.python}
    /model/comp[0] <type 'moose.melement'>
    /model/comp[1] <type 'moose.melement'>
    /model/comp[2] <type 'moose.melement'>
~~~~

Thus elements are instances of class `melement`. All elements in an
`ematrix` share the `id_` of the `ematrix` which can retrieved by
`melement.getId()`.

A frequent use case is that after loading a model from a file one
knows the paths of various model components but does not know the
appropriate class name for them. For this scenario there is a
function called `element` which converts ("casts" in programming
jargon) a path or any moose object to its proper MOOSE class. You
can create additional references to `soma` in the example this
way:

~~~~{.python}
    x = moose.element('/model/soma')
~~~~

Any MOOSE class can be extended in Python. But any additional
attributes added in Python are invisible to MOOSE. So those can be
used for functionalities at the Python level only. You can see
`Demos/squid/squid.py` for an example.

## `Finfos`

The following kinds of `Finfo` are accessible in Python

-   **`valueFinfo`** :
    simple values. For each readable `valueFinfo` `XYZ` there is a
    `destFinfo` `get_XYZ` that can be used for reading the value at run
    time. If `XYZ` is writable then there will also be `destFinfo` to
    set it: `set_XYZ`. Example: `Compartment.Rm`
-   **`lookupFinfo`** :
    lookup tables. These fields act like Python dictionaries but
    iteration is not supported. Example: `Neutral.neighbours`.
-   **`srcFinfo`** :
    source of a message. Example: `PulseGen.outputOut`.
-   **`destFinfo`** :
    destination of a message. Example: `Compartment.injectMsg`.
    Apart from being used in setting up messages, these are accessible
    as functions from Python. `HHGate.setupAlpha` is an example.
-   **`sharedFinfo`** :
    a composition of source and destination fields. Example:
    `Compartment.channel`.

# Moving on

Now you know the basics of pymoose and how to access the help
system. MOOSE is backward compatible with GENESIS and most GENESIS
classes have been reimplemented in MOOSE. There is slight change in
naming (MOOSE uses CamelCase), and setting up messages are
different. But
[GENESIS documentation](http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/Hyperdoc/Manual.html)
is still a good source for documentation on classes that have been
ported from GENESIS.

In addition, the `Demos/snippets` directory in your MOOSE
installation has small executable python scripts that show usage of
specific classes or functionalities. Beyond that you can browse the
code in the `Demos` directory to see some more complex models.

If the built-in MOOSE classes do not satisfy your needs entirely,
you are welcome to add new classes to MOOSE. The
API documentation will help you get started. Finally
you can join the
[moose mailing list](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/moose-generic)
and request for help.

[^1]: To list the classes only, use `moose.le('/classes')`

[^2]: MOOSE is unit agnostic and things should work fine
as long as you use values all converted to a consistent unit
system.

[^3]: This apparently convoluted implementation is for
performance reason. Can you figure out why?
*Hint: the table is driven by a slower clock than the compartment.*

[^4]: In principle any function available in a MOOSE class
can be executed periodically this way as long as that class exposes
the function for scheduling following the MOOSE API. So you have to
consult the class' documentation for any nonstandard methods that
can be scheduled this way.
