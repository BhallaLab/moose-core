This is v0.2 of libneuroml packaged for MOOSE. The latest sources can
be obtained from:

https://neuroml.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/neuroml/TestLibNeuroML/v0.2/libneuroml/

You can check out the latest development snapshot from subversion using:

svn co https://neuroml.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/neuroml/TestLibNeuroML/v0.2/libneuroml/


Dependencies: libneuroml depends on libxml2.


Building:

To build the libneuroml.so run make in this directory.  The default
make creates a static library libneuroml.a. For dynamic library
(required for pymoose) run make like this:

make TYPE=dynamic


Then copy libneuroml.a (or libneuroml.so) to ${MOOSE_SOURCE}/external/lib/
and copy all the header files to ${MOOSE_SOURCE}/external/include/libneuroml using:

mkdir ../include/neuroML
cp *.h ../include/neuroML

Also make sure that you remove any older copy of libneuroml.so in the usual library search path (/usr/lib, /usr/local/lib).
Now the moose compilation should work with the supplied Makefiles for neuroML_IO.
If you are using libneuroml as a dynamic library (for example, with pymoose), you have to either copy libneuroml.so to a location searched for libraries (like /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib) or add the location of libneuroml.so to LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. For bash, this will be:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${MOOSE_SOURCE}/external/lib
