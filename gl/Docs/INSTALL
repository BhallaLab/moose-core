External libaries and compiling MOOSE with support for the GLcell
and GLview elements:
------------------------------------------------------------------

This package has been built with the following external
libaries. These must be compiled and installed on the target machine
before this package can be expected to be functional. Although
previous versions of each external library as indicated may work, it
is recommended that the versions listed (or newer) are installed for
the use of this package.

a. OpenSceneGraph, Stable Release 2.8.0: 
http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg/wiki/Downloads

b. Boost C++ libaries, Version 1.39.0:
http://www.boost.org/users/download/

Specifically the following Boost libraries are required:

	     Serialization
	     Thread
	     Filesystem
	     System 

After these have been installed, MOOSE can be built with support for
GLcell and GLview by supplying the command-line parameter 'USE_OSG=1',
as in:

> make clean
> make USE_OSG=1

This is in the main MOOSE directory. An alternative is to export
USE_OSG as an environment variable with a value of 1:

> export USG_OSG=1
> make clean
> make
