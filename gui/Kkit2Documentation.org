Kinetikit 12: Interface for chemical kinetic models in MOOSEGUI.
#+AUTHOR: Upi Bhalla: documentation, Harsha Rani, H. Chaitanya: GUI.

* Introduction
  Kinetikit 12 is a graphical interface for doing chemical kinetic
  modeling in MOOSE. It is derived in part from Kinetikit, which was
  the graphical interface used in GENESIS for similar
  models. Kinetikit, also known as kkit, was at version 11 with
  GENESIS. Here we start with Kinetikit 12.

** What are chemical kinetic models
   A large fraction of neuronal computation occurs through chemical
   signaling.  For example, many forms of synaptic plasticity begin
   with calcium influx into the synapse, followed by calcium binding
   to calmodulin, and then calmodulin activation of numerous
   enzymes. These events can be represented in chemical terms:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
   4 Ca^{2+} + CaM <---> Ca_4.CaM
#+END_QUOTE
   Such chemical equations can be modeled through standard Ordinary
   Differential Equations, if we ignore space:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
   d[Ca]/dt = -4 * Kf * [Ca]^4 * [CaM] + 4 * Kb * [Ca_4.CaM]
   d[CaM]/dt = -Kf * [Ca]^4 * [CaM] + Kb * [Ca_4.CaM]
   d[Ca_4.CaM]/dt = Kf * [Ca]^4 * [CaM] - Kb * [Ca_4.CaM]
#+END_QUOTE
   MOOSE models these chemical systems. This help document describes
   how to do such modelling using the graphical interface,
   Kinetikit 2.

** Levels of model
   At present Kinetikit handles compartmental models but does not
   compute diffusion within the compartments, though MOOSE itself can
   do this at the script level. Kkit12 will do deterministic as well
   as stochastic chemical calculations.

** Numerical methods
   + Deterministic :: Adaptive timestep 5th order Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg
                      from the GSL (GNU Scientific Library).
   + Stochastic :: Optimized Gillespie Stochastic Systems Algorithm,
                   custom implementation.

* Using Kinetikit 12

** Overview
   + Load models using File->Load. Chemical schematic appears in
     'Model layout' tab.
   + Run models using 'Run' button.
   + View plots by clicking on 'Plot Window' tab.
   + View parameters in 'Model layout' tab by clicking on icons, and
     looking at entries in 'Properties' table to the right.
   + Edit parameters by changing their values in the 'Properties' table.
   + Plot variables belonging to an object by clicking on its icon,
     and then clicking 'Add Field' in the 'Plot Configuration' panel.
   + Manipulate and save plots using the icons at the bottom of the
     'Plot Window'.

** Model layout and icons
   When you are in the 'Model layout' tab you will see a collection of
   icons, arrows, and grey boxes surrounding these. This is a
   schematic of the reaction scheme being modeled. You can view and
   change parameters, and change the layout of the model. In the next
   MOOSE release you will also be able to add and remove molecules and
   reactions.

*** Compartment
    The 'compartment' in moose is usually but not always contiguous
    domain in which a certain set of chemical reactions and molecular
    species occur. The definition is very closely related to that of a
    cell-biological compartment. Examples include the extracellular
    space, the cell membrane, the cytosol, and the
    nucleus. Compartments can be nested, ways, but of course you
    cannot put a bigger compartment into a smaller one.
    + *Icon* Grey boundary around a set of reactions. 
    + *Compartment editable parameters*
       + Name :: The name of the compartment.
       + Size :: This is the volume, surface area or length of the
                 compartment, depending on its type.

    + *Compartment fixed parameters*
      + numDimensions :: This specifies whether the compartment is a
                          volume, a 2-D surface, or if it is just
                          being represented as a length.
    + *Moving Compartments* Click and drag on the boundary.
    + *Resizing Compartment boundary* Happens automatically when
       contents are repositioned, so that the boundary just contains
       contents.

*** Pool
    This is the set of molecules of a given species within a
    compartment. Different chemical states of the same molecule are
    in different pools.
    + *Icon* Colored rectangle with pool name in it.
    + *Pool editable parameters*
      + Name :: Name of the pool
      + n :: Number of molecules in the pool
      + nInit :: Initial number of molecules in the pool. 'n' gets
                 set to this value when the 'Reinit' operation is
                 done.
      + conc :: Concentration of the molecules in the pool.
                #+BEGIN_QUOTE
                conc = n * unit\_scale\_factor / (NA * vol)
                #+END_QUOTE
      + concInit :: Initial concentration of the molecules in the
                    pool.
                    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
		     concInit = nInit * unit\_scale\_factor / (NA * vol)
                    #+END_QUOTE
		     'conc' is set to this value when the 'Reinit' operation is
                    done.
    + *Pool fixed parameters*
      + size :: Derived from the compartment that holds the
                pool. Specifies volume, surface area or length of the
                holding compartment.
    + *Moving pools* Click and drag.

*** Buffered pools
    Some pools are set to a fixed n and concentration throughout a
    simulation. These are buffered pools.
    + *Icon* Colored rectangle with pool name in it.
    + *Buffered Pool editable parameters*
      + Name :: Name of the pool
      + nInit :: Fixed number of molecules in the pool.  'n' gets set
                 to this value throughout the run.
      + concInit :: Fixed concentration of the molecules in
		     the pool.
        #+BEGIN_QUOTE
	 concInit = nInit * unit\_scale\_factor / (NA * vol)
	 #+END_QUOTE
     'conc' is set to this value throughout the run.
    + *Pool fixed parameters*
      + n :: Number of molecules in the pool. Derived from 'nInit'.
      + conc :: Concentration of molecules in the pool.  Derived from
                'concInit'.
      + size :: Derived from the compartment that holds the
                pool. Specifies volume, surface area or length of the
                holding compartment.
    + *Moving Buffered pools* Click and drag.

*** Reaction
    These are conversion reactions between sets of pools.  They are
    reversible, but you can set either of the rates to zero to get
    irreversibility.
    + *Icon* Reversible reaction arrow.
    + *Reaction editable parameters*
      + *Name* Name of reaction
      + *Kf* Forward rate of reaction, in concentration/time
        units. This is the normal way to express and manipulate the
        reaction rate.
      + *kf* Forward rate of reaction, in number/time units. This is
        used internally for computations, but is volume-dependent and
        should not be used to manipulate the reaction rate unless you
        really know what you are doing.
      + *Kb* Backward rate of reaction, in concentration/time
        units. This is the normal way to express and manipulate the
        reaction rate.
      + *kb* Backward rate of reaction, in number/time units. This is
        used internally for computations, but is volume-dependent and
        should not be used to manipulate the reaction rate unless you
        really know what you are doing.
    + *Reaction fixed parameters*
      + numProducts :: Number of product molecules
      + numSubstrates :: Number of substrates molecules
    + *Moving Reactions* Click and drag.

*** Mass-action enzymes
    These are enzymes that model the chemical equations
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    E + S <===> E.S ---> E + P
    #+END_QUOTE
    Note that the second reaction is irreversible. Note also that
    mass-action enzymes require the creation of a pool to represent
    the E.S (enzyme-substrate) complex.

    + *Icon* Colored ellipse atop a small square. The ellipse
      represents the enzyme The small square represents E.S, the
      enzyme-substrate complex.

      The ellipse icon has the same color as the enzyme E.  It is
      connected to the enzyme pool E with a straight line of the same
      color.

      The ellipse icon sits on a continuous, typically curved arrow
      in red, from the substrate to the product.

      A given enzyme pool can have any number of enzyme activities,
      since the same enzyme might catalyze many reactions.

    + *Enzyme editable parameters*
      + Name :: Name of enzyme.
      + Km :: Michaelis-Menten value for enzyme, in concentration units.
      + kcat :: Production rate of enzyme, in 1/time units.  Equal to
               k3, the rate of the second, irreversible reaction.
      + k1 :: Forward rate of the E+S reaction, in number and 1/time
              units. This is what is used in the internal calculations.
      + k2 :: Backward rate of the E+S reaction, in 1/time units. Used
              in internal calculations.
      + k3 :: Forward rate of the E.S---> E + P reaction, in 1/time
              units. Equivalent to kcat.  Used in internal
              calculations.
      + ratio :: Ratio of k2/k3. Needed to define the internal rates
                 in terms of Km and kcat. I usually use a value of 4.

    + *Enzyme-substrate-complex editable parameters* 
 
      These are identical to those of any other pool.
      + Name :: Name of the E.S complex. Defaults to
       '<enzymeName>\_cplx'.
      + n :: Number of molecules in the pool
      + nInit :: Initial number of molecules in the complex.  'n' gets
                set to this value when the 'Reinit' operation is done.
      + conc :: Concentration of the molecules in the pool.
       #+BEGIN_QUOTE
       conc = n * unit\_scale\_factor / (NA * vol)
       #+END_QUOTE
      + concInit :: Initial concentration of the molecules in 
 		  the pool.
                   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
 		  concInit = nInit * unit\_scale\_factor / (NA * vol)
                   #+END_QUOTE
 		  'conc' is set to this value when the 'Reinit'
                   operation is done.

    + *Enzyme-substrate-complex fixed parameters*
      + size :: Derived from the compartment that holds the
      pool. Specifies volume, surface area or length of the holding
      compartment. Note that the Enzyme-substrate-complex is assumed
      to be in the same compartment as the enzyme molecule.

    + *Moving Enzymes* Click and drag on the ellipse.
     
*** Michaelis-Menten Enzymes
    These are enzymes that obey the 
    Michaelis-Menten equation
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    V = Vmax*[S]/(Km+[S]) = kcat*[Etot]*[S]/(Km+[S])
    where Vmax is the maximum rate of the enzyme,
    [Etot] is the total amount of the enzyme
    Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant
    S is the substrate.
    #+END_QUOTE
    Nominally these enzymes model the same chemical equation as the
    mass-action enzyme:
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    E + S <===> E.S ---> E + P
    #+END_QUOTE
    but they make the assumption that the E.S is in a quasi-
    steady-state with E and S, and they also ignore sequestration of
    the enzyme into the complex. So there is no representation of the
    E.S complex.
    + *Icon* Colored ellipse. The ellipse represents the enzyme The
      ellipse icon has the same color as the enzyme E.  It is
      connected to the enzyme pool E with a straight line of the same
      color.  The ellipse icon sits on a continuous, typically curved
      arrow in red, from the substrate to the product.  A given
      enzyme pool can have any number of enzyme activities, since the
      same enzyme might catalyze many reactions.
    + *Enzyme editable parameters*
       + Name :: Name of enzyme.
       + Km :: Michaelis-Menten value for enzyme, in concentration
            units.
       + kcat :: Production rate of enzyme, in 1/time units.  Equal to
              k3, the rate of the second, irreversible reaction.
    + *Moving Enzymes* Click and drag.

*** SumTotal
    This is a pool whose concentration is just the sum of
    the concentrations of pools connected into it.  It behaves like a
    buffer whose concentration varies as the simulation proceeds Note
    that this violates mass conservation: One can use a SumTotal in a
    reaction, just like a buffer, but the SumTotal itself will never
    be depleted. Typically used when we have multiple molecular forms
    of an enzyme, all with similar activity, and we just want to use
    a single enzyme activity to represent the whole lot.

    + *Icon* Colored rectangle with pool name. The input pools
      connect to the SumTotal with blue arrows.

    + *SumTotal editable parameters*
      + Name :: Name of the pool

    + *Pool fixed parameters*
      + n :: Number of molecules in the pool. Computed as it runs.
      + conc :: Concentration of molecules in the pool.  Computed as it
             runs.
      + size :: Derived from the compartment that holds the
             pool. Specifies volume, surface area or length of the
             holding compartment.

    + *Moving SumTotals* Click and drag.
  
** Model operations
   - *Loading models* File->Load Model-> select from dialog.  This
     operation deletes the previously loaded model.  Currently only
     understands Kkit.g format models.
   - *Saving models* File->Save Model->select from dialog.
     Currently only understands Kkit.g format models.
   - *Merging models* File->Merge Model -> select from dialog. This
     operation tries to merge the new model into the currently loaded
     model. It does so by recognizing existing molecular pool names,
     and not duplicating those. Instead, any new reactions involving
     the existing pools get tied into the existing model. All other
     new pools and reactions are created as usual. Note that
     parameters of existing pools get updated to values from the new
     model.
   - *Changing numerical methods* Solver menu item in title bar has
     options. Currently supports:
     + Runge Kutta :: This is the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg implementation
                      from the Gnu Scientific Library (GSL). It is a
                      fifth order variable timestep explicit
                      method. Works well for most reaction systems
                      except if they have very stiff reactions.
     + Gillespie :: Optimized Gillespie Stochastic Systems Algorithm,
                    custom implementation. This uses variable timesteps
                    internally.  Note that it slows down with
                    increasing numbers of molecules in each pool. It
                    also slows down, but not so badly, if the number of
                    reactions goes up.
