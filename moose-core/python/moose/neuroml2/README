NeuroML2 is a moving target and the current parser was generated from
the schema publicly available on Jul 28 10:18:38 2013 using the
generateDS.py module.

This is broken with respect to NeuroML_v2beta3. Morphology loading
works, but ion channels are not visible in the parsed document. This
version of NeuroML2 has a mix of ionChannel and ionChannelHH and from
the comments in the schema the situation seems to be inconsistent.

You can install generateDS.py and generate the Python wrappers for the
latest schema as follows:

generateDS.py -o generated_neuroml.py -s generated_neuromlsub.py ~/src/neuroml_dev/NeuroML2/Schemas/NeuroML2/NeuroML_v2beta.xsd

Replace the last argument with the path to NeurML xsd.

The other python files in this directory were hand-coded. So you may
need to tweak them in case NeuroML2 has some incompatible changes or
adds new types.
