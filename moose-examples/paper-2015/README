Here we have Python scripts that replicate most of the figures in the MOOSE
paper. Most of these can be accessed through the MooseGUI startup screen.
Some of these take a very long time. Approximate runtimes for a 2.2 GHz 
core I7 processor are listed here.
Some of these figures/demos depend on the 3-D graphics visualization, which 
may not be compiled into your distribution. 

The figure scripts are in the directories Fig<N>_<description>
and are named Fig2A, Fig3D etc.

Figure panel	Runtime(s)	Uses 3-D?	Notes
