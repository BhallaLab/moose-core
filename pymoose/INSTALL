The complete PyMoose installation depends on several other
packages. There are two major components:

1. The moose module. 
2. The gui component.

1. The moose module is the core of the simulation system. You can
import this module in your python scripts to set up a model and
simulate it.

It can use the libSBML library for SBML support. And OpenSceneGraph
library for OpenGL visualization. You can skip either or both of these
when compiling. Do remember to execute "make clean" before a rebuild
because if your compilation options in two consecutive builds are
different, it may result in linking error or unusable dynamic library.

For compiling this you need to have the following:

g++
swig vesrion >= 1.3.36
Python >= 2.5
Python development libraries >= 2.5 

---------------
[Optional] GNU Scienticfic Library >= 1.12 
development version.

---------------

[Optional] SBML Support:
libSBML 3.4.1
libxml2 development libraries.

---------------

[Optional] OpenGL Support:

OpenSceneGraph >= 2.8.0
boost C++ libraries version >= 1.39.0:
- Boost Serialization
- Boost Thread
- Boost Filesystem
- Boost System 

----------------

2. GUI is based on PyQt widgets and the plotting is done using
PyQwt. So you need the following libraries:


[Optinal] Qt based Gui 

Qt4 >= 4.3

PyQt4 >= 4.3


Qwt5

PyQwt5-qt4 (>= 5.2.0) (If you get "undefined symbol" error in Ubuntu
karmic, try:
https://launchpad.net/~eudoxos/+archive/ppa/+sourcepub/785933/+listing-archive-extra)

----------------

[Recomended] matplotlib with numpy (some of the examples use it to
plot data).


BUILDING:

Go to the moose directory and to compile with the default options:

make pymoose

To control the options look at the documentation in Makefile in that
directory. Depending on your Python.h location, you may have to modify

pymoose/Makefile 

(replace the directories ending with python2.6 to
wherever you Python development headers and libraries are located).
