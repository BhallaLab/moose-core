* TODO Improve NumPy SUPPORT
  This is deferred until we have pressing need to do so.
  
** NumPy version 1.1.1 required.
   In older versions, the enums in numpy/ndarrayobject.h have a trailing comma
   which gives compilation error. This has been fixed in numpy 1.1.1

* DONE Fix PyMooseContext::readCell
   The format is just opposite GENESIS, should make GENESIS like to avoid ugly surprise.
   Files to be affected:
   PyMooseContext.h, PyMooseContext.cpp
   examples/axon/axon.py
   any python script using readCell
   
* DONE Changed path from member function to member variable
  Earlier I was forced to supply accessor path() for retrieving the MOOSE path
  for an object. Whenever I tried to emulate a member variable path using
  __get_path(), any access to object.path caused a segmentation fault, while
  another similar function name() did not cause any problem. Now I
  think I have figured out the reason. 

  name was not creating any problem because it is actually a member variable
  in the corresponding moose object, whereas path is actually a local variable
  in one of the inner moose functions. That is why this memory was getting
  deallocated before PyMOOSE had an opportunity to access it. Now I am
  assigning all string values to PyMooseContext::fieldValue_ and then
  returning it. This should solve the problem. <2008-11-21 01:33:27 (+0530)>

* DONE Improved introspection
  Now PyMOOSE objects have a member variable className which provides the
  Class Name of the underlying MOOSE element. The older function getType()
  will be deprecated because it worked at the python level and as you wrap an
  existing object in another class, the getType() functioned returned the name
  of the new class instead of the original MOOSE class, just like python.
  for example 
  c = moose.Compartment("/c")
  d = moose.HHChannel("/c")
  print c.getType(), d.getType()

  would have printed:
  >>> Compartment HHChannel

  although the actual moose object is still a Compartment.

  But now,
  print c.className, d.className

  will print:
  >>> Compartment Compartment

  There was a bug in it - every class had a static const member variable
  className for providing the class name to the base class constructor. This
  was shadowing the actual className of the underlying object. Converted the
  above mentioned constant to className_.

* CODING JUSTIFICATIONS
  The principle of least surprise requires PyMOOSE to stick closely to the
  GENESIS commands. But we also want PyMOOSE to be more intuitive to the
  new-comer than GENESIS was. When we deviate from the GENESIS conventions, or
  do some coding whose reason is not obvious, here we put the justifications.

** addmsg converted to connect
   Because connect is a meaningful english word whereas addmsg is a
   programmer's shortened word for "add message". The principle is to use
   something meaningful, and a full word instead of abbreviation whenever
   possible. This is a coding style guideline in many organizations.




** New help() function introduced for retrieving pymoose objects/classes
   The Python functions and fields do not match MOOSE exactly (sometimes names
   change, additional functions are introduced in PyMOOSE, etc. Swig autodoc
   option automatically inserts quite a bit of documentation (at least
   function parameter names and data types) which returned by python built-in
   help function. So I prefer to maintain both MOOSE built-in help and python
   help system as complementary documentation.

* INCONSISTENCIES
  There are places where MOOSE and/or PyMOOSE are inconsistent in coding
  conventions or naming conventions. We need to weed them out before going to
  production.

** Table::step_mode/stepmode in MOOSE, stepMode in PyMOOSE.
   We should decide on underscore vs camel-case and follow on way or the
   other.

** SigNeur::lambda has been renamed to lambda_ as lambda is a python keyword.
