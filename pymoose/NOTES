* TODO
** Fix PyMooseContext::readCell
   The format is just opposite GENESIS, should make GENESIS like to avoid ugly surprise.
   Files to be affected:
   PyMooseContext.h, PyMooseContext.cpp
   examples/axon/axon.py
   any python script using readCell

* CODING JUSTIFICATIONS
  The principle of least surprise requires PyMOOSE to stick closely to the
  GENESIS commands. But we also want PyMOOSE to be more intuitive to the
  new-comer than GENESIS was. When we deviate from the GENESIS conventions, or
  do some coding whose reason is not obvious, here we put the justifications.

** addmsg converted to connect
   Because connect is a meaningful english word whereas addmsg is a
   programmer's shortened word for "add message". The principle is to use
   something meaningful, and a full word instead of abbreviation whenever
   possible. This is a coding style guideline in many organizations.
