* TODO Improve NumPy SUPPORT
  This is deferred until we have pressing need to do so.
  
** NumPy version 1.1.1 required. 
   In older versions, the enums in numpy/ndarrayobject.h have a trailing comma
   which gives compilation error. This has been fixed in numpy 1.1.1

* DONE Fix PyMooseContext::readCell
   The format is just opposite GENESIS, should make GENESIS like to avoid ugly surprise.
   Files to be affected:
   PyMooseContext.h, PyMooseContext.cpp
   examples/axon/axon.py
   any python script using readCell
   

* CODING JUSTIFICATIONS
  The principle of least surprise requires PyMOOSE to stick closely to the
  GENESIS commands. But we also want PyMOOSE to be more intuitive to the
  new-comer than GENESIS was. When we deviate from the GENESIS conventions, or
  do some coding whose reason is not obvious, here we put the justifications.

** addmsg converted to connect
   Because connect is a meaningful english word whereas addmsg is a
   programmer's shortened word for "add message". The principle is to use
   something meaningful, and a full word instead of abbreviation whenever
   possible. This is a coding style guideline in many organizations.




* INCONSISTENCIES
  There are places where MOOSE and/or PyMOOSE are inconsistent in coding
  conventions or naming conventions. We need to weed them out before going to
  production.

** Table::step_mode/stepmode in MOOSE, stepMode in PyMOOSE. 
   We should decide on underscore vs camel-case and follow on way or the
   other.

** SigNeur::lambda has been renamed to lambda_ as lambda is a python keyword.
