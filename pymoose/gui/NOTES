The plan for the GUI is:
    Left dock widget contains a toolbox with all MOOSE classes - divided into categories.

    Right dock widget is a property editor for the current object
    
    Central widget is a workspace - like that in electronics workbench

    Users can select objects from toolbox and add them to workspace.

    Do not create the MOOSE structure immediately - because the user
    may want to move things around; rather start creating a NeuroML
    document?

    Create the moose model once the user hits the reset/run button


    For each object, there should be an incoming and an outgoing node
    point. On this node point a user can select a message and join it
    to a complementery message.


    Use model/view architecture - MOOSE structure nicely falls into
    the TreeModel category. No problem with the model. 

    The view is tricky - need to allow nice graphics, allow drag and
    drop. Started with a QGroupBox but that is insufficient.

    Multilevel tree veiw is perhaps not so important. Inserting a
    PulseGen as a child of a compartment is not so intuitive. Nor is
    it supported by the standard languages.
