"""neuroml2 submodule handles NeuroML2 models in MOOSE.

NML2Reader class allows reading of NeuroML2 cell models with
Hodgkin-Huxley type ion channels.

The [Ca2+] dependent channel reading may be incomplete.

Some functions for converting in-memory MOOSE models into NeuroML2 are
available in converter.py. But the complete cell-model writing is not
fully implemented. Hence this is not included in __all__.
