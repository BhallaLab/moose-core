<!--NeuroML version of MScelltapershortCM3noproto.p used in genesis 
In the .p file, x is interpreted as length, because y and z are 0, so it can't
be visualized In this .nml file, x and y are given values to produce correct
length, and allow the morphology to be visualized (sort of) 

This is an updated version of the model that will when finished contain updated
data and will be amenable with the latest version of the MOOSE simulator. The
current version of the NML2 reader in the MOOSE simulator is only amenable to
Python version 2, but the developers hope to make this compatible with Python
version 3 soon 

11/28/18 Update: This NML2 model now matches the output of the D1 Neuron
currently in moose_nerp (using the 5 non Calcium dep/perm channels)! It also
appears that the relative coordinates do matter in regards to the distances.
Will most likely need to evaluate and change this in the full model.

Thus why we are including a passive channel declaration in the NML as this will be needed for loading into MOOSE -->
